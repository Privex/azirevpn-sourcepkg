         install-deps    - Generates a DEB containing the build dependencies in it's metadata, and then
                           installs the DEB using 'dpkg -i' which installs the build deps - uses command 'mk-build-deps -i'
         build-deb       - Builds the DEB file using 'dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b' - which will be outputted to the parent directory.

	 deb             - Runs 'install-deps' followed by 'build-deb'
